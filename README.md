# Question: How do you calculate the edit distance between two strings? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided calculates the edit distance between two strings, which is the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into another. The function 'editDistance' is a recursive function that takes four arguments: two strings and their respective lengths. It starts by comparing the last characters of both strings. If they are identical, it moves to the next pair of characters by recursively calling the function with the lengths of the strings reduced by one. If the characters are different, it performs one of three operations: deleting a character from the first string, deleting a character from the second string, or replacing a character in the first string with a character from the second string. Each operation increases the edit distance by one. The function continues this process until it has compared all characters in the strings, and then returns the minimum edit distance. The final result is then printed to the console.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution differs from the JavaScript version in several ways:

1. Type Annotations: TypeScript version uses type annotations to ensure type safety. For example, the function `editDistance` is explicitly declared to take two strings as input and return a number.

2. Dynamic Programming: The TypeScript version uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, which is more efficient than the recursive approach used in the JavaScript version. It creates a 2D array `dp` to store the edit distances between all prefixes of the two strings. This avoids redundant computation of the same subproblems, which happens in the recursive approach.

3. String Lengths: In the JavaScript version, the lengths of the strings are passed as arguments to the function. In the TypeScript version, the lengths are calculated inside the function.

4. String Character Access: The JavaScript version uses array-like indexing to access characters in the strings. The TypeScript version uses the `charAt` method, which is generally considered safer because it doesn't throw an error if the index is out of bounds.

5. Initialization of 2D Array: The TypeScript version uses the `Array.fill` and `Array.map` methods to initialize the 2D array `dp`. This is not present in the JavaScript version.

6. Return Value: The TypeScript version returns the edit distance directly from the `dp` array, while the JavaScript version returns it through recursive calls.

In summary, the TypeScript version is more efficient due to the use of dynamic programming, and it is safer due to the use of type annotations and the `charAt` method.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution is very similar to the JavaScript version. Both versions use a recursive function to calculate the edit distance between two strings. The function takes four arguments: the two strings to compare and their lengths. It then compares the characters of the strings from the end. If the characters are the same, it moves to the next pair of characters. If they are different, it performs one of the three operations and adds 1 to the edit distance. The function returns the minimum edit distance.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in the languages themselves:

1. In the C++ version, the `std::min` function from the `<algorithm>` library is used to find the minimum of three values. In the JavaScript version, the `Math.min` function is used for the same purpose.

2. The C++ version uses `std::string` to represent strings, while the JavaScript version uses the built-in string type.

3. The C++ version uses `std::cin` and `std::cout` for input and output, while the JavaScript version uses `console.log` for output.

4. The C++ version includes a `main` function, which is the entry point of the program. The JavaScript version does not have a similar concept.

5. The C++ version uses `<iostream>`, `<string>`, and `<vector>` libraries, while the JavaScript version does not use any external libraries.

6. The C++ version requires explicit declaration of data types, while JavaScript is dynamically typed.

7. The C++ version uses pass-by-value for string parameters in the function, creating a copy of the strings for each recursive call, which could lead to higher memory usage. JavaScript, on the other hand, passes strings by reference, which is more memory efficient.
